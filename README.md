# Tasheel
ðŸ§© Project Description â€“ Tasheel Job Platform
Tasheel is a smart, AI-integrated job and service management platform that connects clients with freelancers or service providers (workers) in a secure, structured, and data-driven environment. Inspired by the modern design of the JobEntry HTML5 template, the platform provides both a visually appealing user experience and a comprehensive backend system to handle tasks, contracts, payments, ratings, support, and AI-based insights.

ðŸŒŸ Purpose of the Platform
The goal of Tasheel is to streamline the process of service booking, delivery, and management by combining intuitive UI with strong backend logic. It ensures transparency between users (clients and workers), enhances trust through feedback and analytics, and integrates smart features to detect anomalies or recommend services using AI.

ðŸ“Š Key Features
1. User Roles
The platform supports three types of users:

Clients: People looking to hire service providers.

Workers: Freelancers or professionals offering services.

Admins: Manage platform operations, resolve disputes, and monitor overall activity.

Each user profile includes contact details, login credentials, role, location, and status (active/inactive/suspended).

2. Service Listings
Service providers can define the services they offer, with details like:

Service name and description

Category assignment

Price and estimated completion time

Availability status (active, inactive, pending)

3. Task Management
Clients can assign service-related tasks to workers. Tasks are tracked through various statuses (pending, in progress, completed, or cancelled). The system supports:

Scheduling start times

Logging actual start times

Tracking progress and summaries

Payment status per task

4. Contracts
Formal digital agreements can be created between clients and workers to define expectations, terms, and service scopes. Each contract records who signed it, when, and its status (active, completed, or terminated).

5. Payments
Payments related to tasks are securely logged with:

Transaction amounts

Method of payment (credit card, PayPal, or bank transfer)

Payment status (pending, completed, or failed)

Fraud detection flag for enhanced security

6. Ratings and Feedback
After completing a task, clients can rate workers and leave feedback. The system can apply AI-based sentiment analysis on the feedback to determine emotional tone (positive, negative, or neutral).

7. Recommendations Engine
The platform can provide personalized service recommendations to users, based on previous behavior, feedback, or AI analysis. Each recommendation includes:

Suggested service ID

Reason for recommendation

Confidence score

8. AI-Powered Anomaly Detection
Tasheel includes an AI insights module to detect unusual patterns or issues in task execution. This helps flag:

Unexpected delays

Miscommunication

Suspected fraud or inconsistencies

9. Support System
Users can raise support tickets in case of problems. Each ticket contains:

Issue category (technical, payment, service quality, etc.)

Priority level (low, medium, high)

Status (open, in progress, resolved, closed)

Timestamps for creation and resolution

ðŸ§  AI & Smart Features
Tasheel is designed to leverage artificial intelligence in several key areas:

Sentiment analysis of feedback to auto-flag potential issues.

Anomaly detection in task behaviors and transactions.

Smart recommendations to guide users toward suitable services.

ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Template Integration (JobEntry)
The platform is visually powered by the JobEntry template by ThemeWagon https://themewagon.github.io/jobentry/  . This professional, mobile-friendly HTML/CSS theme is repurposed to serve dynamic content such as:

Lists of services and tasks

User dashboards for clients and workers

Contact and support pages

Contract and feedback forms

Recommendations and AI alerts

While the original template is static, Tasheel transforms it into a fully dynamic application by connecting the front end to a structured backend database.

ðŸŽ¯ Future Expansion Possibilities
Tasheel is designed with scalability in mind. Potential future upgrades include:

Responsive with Mobile 

Live chat between clients and workers

Advanced analytics dashboards for admin users

Role-based permissions system

Multilingual support

Migration from MyISAM to InnoDB for stronger data relationships and transactional integrity
